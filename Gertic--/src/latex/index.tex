This project uses the knowledge aquired in LCOM classes of how to build driver for different components of a computer to build a simple game. It uses concepts of how to use a computer timer, keyboard, mouse, display (gpu), and others.

This work was done within the scope of the Compute Laboratory course, and aimed at deepening the knowledge about to use the inteface of common peripherals, and program in C for low level applications.

All these recreates a simple OS where a player is able to draw and another is able to guess what it is being drawn. It uses the mouse to draw to the screen and select buttons, the keyboard to type and use button shortcuts, graphics (gpu) to display the GUI of the game, the timer to control flow o information and play time, serial port to control the sharing of information between the different machines, and many more.
